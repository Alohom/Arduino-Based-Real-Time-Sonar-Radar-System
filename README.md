# Arduino-Based-Real-Time-Sonar-Radar-System
A real-time radar system developed using Arduino, ultrasonic sensor, and servo motor. It scans the environment, measures object distance, and visualizes it on a dynamic radar screen. This project focuses on real-time data processing and visual representation. It demonstrates principles of robotics, communication, and interface design.
